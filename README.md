# UFO analysis

##Overview
The purpose of this project was to utilize javascript, along with bootstrap, to apply styling and filters to a set of data we are providing for the UFO sightings.  

##Results
We were able to produce a webpage in which you can reach the article on the sightings and have some data to sort through for yourself to back up some of the articles claims.  

##Summary
One drawback to this way of providing vizulations and tables for data is that it can be limiting on how the user can interrupt the data.  They will only see filtered results from a table but not the data as a whole picture.
This type of data analysis and delivery can provide many different functions such as being able to sort through sports statistics and/or weather patterns.
